## What Is MAUPP ?

---

The MAUPP project (**M**odelling and forecasting **A**frican **U**rban **P**opulation **P**atterns for vulnerability and health assessments) is a four-year research project (2014-2018) funded by the STEREO-III program of the Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO).

The main objective of MAUPP is to develop models and forecasts to improve our knowledge of sub-Saharan African urban population patterns for a wider usage of urban population distribution datasets in vulnerability and health assessments. The MAUPP project aims to contribute to the [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org) open access archive of spatial demographic datasets.

Built-up and population maps at moderate spatial resolution (12.5m) will be produced for [48 african cities](page/cities) and for five distinct years: 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. Very high spatial resolution built-up and population maps will also be produced for 3 cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Dakar (Senegal) and Saint-Louis (Senegal).
